# Goal: browser should not cache (and should always revalidate) the index.html.
# For that matter we add `Cache-Control "no-cache"` header.
# But as index.html could be returned from arbitrary URL (e.g. '/', '/products', '/products/1/details', etc
# we are defining IF condition as 'NOT (all_routes_that_should_be_cached))'
if ($uri ~ ^/(?!(api|static|images|icons|dictionaries))) {

}

# Also there are some special files that might not suit the condition above, but should be also cached
# We explicitly list them here (e.g. `/manifest.json`, `/robots.txt`, and other similar files at the site root)
